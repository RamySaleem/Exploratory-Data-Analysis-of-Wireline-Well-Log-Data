# Analysis of Wireline Petrophysical Data
## Summary:
  • Explored 118 wells with over 1 million rows and 29 columns of wireline petrophysical data using the Pandas library.
  • Analysed and visualised the wireline logs petrophysical dataset using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and seaborn libraries.
  • Identified insights related to wireline logs quality and interpretation including issues like missing data, class imbalances, and outliers, as well as production performance.

## Objective:
This study aims to explore and visualise the petrophysical data of wireline logs and their subsets to analyse subsurface lithologies. These lithologies describe the combination of rock layers forming given subsurface formations. The dataset comprises 98 wells and their respective wireline logs. Python provides an excellent toolset for visualising the data from various perspectives quickly and efficiently. We employed log plots, histograms, and cross plots (scatter plots) to analyse and explore well log data.
